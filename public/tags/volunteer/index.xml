    <description><![CDATA[<p><em>This is my diary about the trip to Sapa Hope Center with 10 colleagues from Summit Education - a renowned English language teaching center in Hanoi. Therefore, this trip is aimed at fostering cultural exchange and teaching English and basic skills to students from Grade 1 to Grade 2 in Sapa, Lao Cai.</em></p>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<p>After many days of anticipation for new tasks and challenges – my first time as a cameraman – on the charity trip to Sapa with Summit, today finally arrived. I woke up quite early, having only slept for 3 hours the night before. I should have slept more, but I woke up at 3:40 am. After brushing my teeth, I fumbled on my computer to download videos on photography tutorials from YouTube to watch and learn on the way (I was assigned to take photos even though I&rsquo;ve never held a camera before -))). I downloaded the videos and finished preparing my gear by 4:40 am, then called my dad to drive me.

Upon arriving at the gathering point, I realized I was early af -)) However, that period was also when I started to play around and learn more about the camera. It was quite fascinating, to be honest, because like everything else, it has its own rules and standards that we can learn in a simple and understandable way. Having said that, after getting on the bus and starting to watch the videos I downloaded earlier, I only got a basic grasp of concepts like lens mm, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, &hellip; And I haven&rsquo;t learned anything about framing angles and positioning yet.

At Sapa Hope Center, the most surprising thing for me was the extremely warm welcome from the kids. Although many of them couldn&rsquo;t speak Vietnamese (Sapa is a land of convergence for 5 different ethnic groups), they were enthusiastic and innocent. As soon as I arrived, the kids gave each of us a flower and a welcoming card, which they had drawn themselves. The drawings looked simple, but I believe they came from the sincere and innocent hearts of these little ones.

During the self-introduction, I was quite surprised when the owner of the center turned out to be a young man (seemingly stepping out of &ldquo;Silent Sapa&rdquo;) who had studied abroad in Singapore. After visiting this place, he fell in love with it, despite numerous opportunities in the city. Even his relatives thought he was &ldquo;charmed&rdquo; (there is a local belief in enchantment being quite common here). He shared many stories about Sapa – the specially nutritious herbs, the underprivileged children lacking sufficient food, the uphill journey from home to school taking 2-3 hours each day, and more. Peter Thương, along with the kids at the center, made me feel moved every time I heard those genuine and simple stories.

After having lunch and a break, we spent the entire afternoon getting to know each child individually to better understand their personalities. This helped us plan and manage the teaching program more effectively for the upcoming days. Despite having only known each other for a few hours, we engaged in drawing exercises, played games, and sang together, creating a strong bond. The room that day was filled with laughter.

After finishing the activities, the sky had darkened, and we were quite tired from the day of travel. We decided to return to the hotel to rest.
