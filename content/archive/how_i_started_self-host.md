- introduction
- origin reason: 
	- mother hp prodesk 600 g4 leftout from office -> don't know if i should seld, get money or just keep finding an use with it.
	- finally spent 1 night to set up xpenology to act as a storage server, but it require a usb to boot every times
	- in an attempt to looking for solutions, i found out proxmox, which is ... so i install my first xpenology vms on it, backing up all my photos.

And then i come up with the idea of hosting it together with HASS to automate the workflow: capturing doubtful person movement outside my house to notify it to my family via Telegram.

	 - yeah, after succesfully achieve a target, i still feel like my self host server could be improve as i do not utilize the most out of it yet (or rather i was too bored with nothing to do at that time)
	- opt for media automation with an *Arr* family apps. i guess this one makes me feel most excited because of how many application have to link with each other (i also set it to link with my Synology NAS via FTP) -> together create an whole network of apps only serving for watching movies like Netflix
