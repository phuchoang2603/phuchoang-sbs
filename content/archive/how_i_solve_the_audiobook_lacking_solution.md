## Backstory
To be honest, im the person who loves to read books ... well, actually, i havent really finish so much books ever in my life, most of them are literature or fiction novels. but even so, i do love the moments when i enjoying the content, imaginery scece that i havent ever thought. the problem is, i do not have enough consistency or patience to read books in long term and everyday, so i often choose to watch films or reading manga instead whenever i have a free time.

back in the day when im just a eight grader, i initially watched a first anime (the begin of my serious hobby that i still have today) called "Classroom of the Elite Season 1". Wow, quite a interesting and attention-seeking name was it. And it turns out I really love the genre of it. Until now, it was still one of the coolest anime I have ever watch... But because it is a adaptation from a light novel and the studio have modified the original version really far that the film may not have another season. It turns out it took 4 years for the studio to decide to make a second season of the series. But, it was really bad that I gradually lose hope to this genre.

But I doubt it cannot be that bad consider the first season was really amazing. Later that I found there were many people who have same opinion with me and they were advised to read the light novel if they still want to experience the content. Well, I did and ... it was amazing. I read non-stop in the summer of my 10th grade and only stop reading it when i was in the school time. But many things in life happened and I just forgot it until recently, I have heard the adaptation of the third season of Classroom of the Elite. And I decided to read it again.

## The problem
But compare when I was a 10th grader, I do not have that much time to devote reading it. So it became rather difficult for me to actually enjoy the content. So I came up with the plan of listening to it when I excercise or riding a bike. It was more motivation for me because at the time, I succesfully install the Audiobookself on my homelab, which is a audiobook management server.
The only thing that I miss at the moment was the content.

So I search all the Google and Youtube but nothing came interesing. There was no official making of audiobook of the series and the content on Youtube was purely a robotic voice which I became bore after several minutes. I tried different TTS reader app like BookFusion but also became bore with it.

But not until I search these two interesting project ...
[Storyteller Docs | Storyteller (smoores.gitlab.io)](https://smoores.gitlab.io/storyteller/)
[p0n1/epub_to_audiobook: EPUB to audiobook converter, optimized for Audiobookshelf (github.com)](https://github.com/p0n1/epub_to_audiobook)

So I decided to come up further, make these to do list
- generate an audiobook file using edge-tts
- sync with the storyteller app
