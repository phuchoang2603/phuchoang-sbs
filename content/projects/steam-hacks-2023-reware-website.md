Built during the first round of STEAM Hacks 2023, Reware is a C2C marketplace inspired by platforms like eBay and Shopee. It enables users to buy and sell refurbished electronics and features self-serve kiosks for convenient device trade-ins. Reware promotes sustainable tech use by giving old devices a second life while offering users cash incentives.
