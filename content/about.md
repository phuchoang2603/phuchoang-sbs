## About me

Greetings! I am **Hoang Xuan Phuc**, but you can simply address me as **Felix**.

Since you’ve taken the time to explore my corner of the internet, I suppose it’s only fair to share a bit more about myself. You might notice that I don’t often open up like this in the offline world—I tend to be somewhat of an introvert. That said, I genuinely enjoy meeting new people and engaging in meaningful conversations. It’s just that, for some reason, talking about myself can be a bit of a challenge.

Perhaps it’s a matter of communication skills. I’ve sometimes struggled to articulate my thoughts, especially when diving into complex ideas. But don’t get me wrong; I’m confident in my ability to strike up a conversation with just about anyone, even strangers. It’s as if my brain goes into overdrive, overthinking every word when I’m attempting to present information. But does an introduction really have to be so complex? I doubt it, right?

Then there’s the notion that maybe there isn’t all that much to tell about me. When someone asks me to talk about myself, I sometimes feel like I should provide a comprehensive biography dating back to my birth. The truth is, even that wouldn’t take more than a minute to recount. What I’ve come to realize, though, is that the subject I could talk about endlessly is the future and the plans I’ve always envisioned.

But that’s not entirely ideal, is it? I don’t want to be the kind of person who can only talk about their hypothetical future while neglecting their actual past. I’m well aware that our lives are shaped by our experiences and the lessons we’ve learned from the challenges we’ve faced. Yet, if you can’t recall those experiences or share them with others, it can feel like a missed opportunity.

So, here’s the reason behind this website. It’s a place where I hope to bridge the gap between my past and my future, sharing my journey, experiences, and thoughts with you and anyone else who stumbles upon it. It’s a way for me to reflect, remember, and, hopefully, inspire others along the way.

Here's some more interesting facts about me:
