If you thought the biggest gaming news was the upcoming Switch 2, think again. The emulation community has made a breakthrough: you can now run Nintendo Switch games on your iPhone or iPad at buttery-smooth 60FPS‚Äîall offline, with no jailbreak, no shady VPNs, and zero sketchiness.

## What is JIT? Why is it important for emulation?
Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is a method used by emulators to dramatically improve performance by converting code into machine instructions while the program is running. Normally, an emulator has to interpret every single instruction one-by-one, which is slow. JIT speeds things up by compiling larger chunks of code in real time, allowing games to run closer to native speeds.
However, Apple has strict security policies that prevent unauthorized JIT execution on iOS devices. There are some workarounds like JITStreamer or SideJITServer but they all require an internet connection. StikJIT and StosVPN now bypass this restriction by enabling JIT locally, without external servers, making offline Nintendo Switch emulation possible on iPhones.
Here's the difference between no JIT vs JIT-enabled when running emulator on iOS.

[PPSSPP On iOS 17 (NO JIT vs JIT) iPhone XR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgdzy7q_dkU)

## StosVPN ‚Äì Internal VPN for enabling JIT without internet
Unlike commercial VPNs that often collect user data, StosVPN simply creates a virtual VPN on the device itself, tricking the system into thinking a ‚Äútrusted connection‚Äù is being made. This lets iOS enable JIT without needing an actual internet connection‚Äîboosting privacy and eliminating security risks.

This is a breakthrough that allows Switch emulators to run fully offline with high performance.

üîê No internet connection needed ‚Äì No data sent out ‚Äì No unusual battery drain.

## Essential Tips Before You Begin

- **Recommended hardware** - IOS 17+, Iphone/Ipad with more than 4 GB RAM.
- **Disable Low Power Mode** ‚Äì Emulation requires full performance. If iOS throttles the CPU, the game will lag.
- **Don‚Äôt close important background apps** ‚Äì Some apps like SideStore and LiveContainer must keep running for stable emulation.
- **Prepare a Windows or macOS computer.** You‚Äôll need one to set up SideStore initially and to generate a pairing file. It's best to put all the needed apps into one folder.
- **Use that folder to transfer games** ‚Äì You can create a Windows shared folder and mount it in the iOS Files app for easier game management.

## Installing SideStore
SideStore is a sideloading tool (lets you install apps outside the App Store) that doesn‚Äôt require jailbreaking and is regularly updated by the community.

**Installation steps:**

1. **Read the official guide for more in-depth tutorials**: [SideStore Docs](https://docs.sidestore.io/docs/getting-started/prerequisites)
2. **Generate a pairing file:**
    - Download `jitterbugpair.exe`
    - Run it and transfer the `*.mobiledevicepairing` file to your phone
![](https://i.imgur.com/zrAO6vQ.png)

3. **Install SideStore:**
    - Install **AltServer** [Windows Guide](https://docs.sidestore.io/docs/getting-started/windows)
    - Hold **Shift + Click** the AltServer tray icon and sideload the SideStore IPA
4. **Final Tweaks:**
    - Install **StosVPN** from the App Store and enable it    
    - Open SideStore, pair it with the pairing file    
    - Refresh the app and remove previous AltServer certificates

**Why we need to refresh Sidestore (you may ask)?**
Normally, Apple limits sideloaded apps (using a free developer account) to 7 days of usage before you have to ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù (i.e., re-sign the IPA with a new certificate).
When you install SideStore using AltServer, it stops using AltServer‚Äôs certificate and instead creates its **own certificate**, managed within the app itself. This means you won‚Äôt need a computer later‚Äîjust open SideStore on your phone and tap ‚ÄúRefresh‚Äù to handle everything automatically.
To do that, SideStore needs a way to simulate a local server environment to trick iOS into thinking the app signing process is legitimate. The trick here is using an internal VPN (StosVPN), which creates a loopback server directly on the device.

## Installing LiveContainer
Apple allows only 3 sideloaded apps to run at once. **LiveContainer** bypasses this by running apps ‚Äúinside‚Äù it, like a virtual machine. Here‚Äôs how to install it:
1. **Download the LiveContainer IPA** from [HugeBlack‚Äôs fork](https://github.com/hugeBlack/LiveContainer/) Actions tab (requires GitHub account)
2. **Open SideStore with StosVPN enabled** and add LiveContainer IPA.
3. **In LiveContainer Settings:** Tap "Patch SideStore/AltStore" to reinstall it with tweaks.
4. **After installation:** Reopen SideStore/AltStore.
5. **Return to LiveContainer:** Tap "Test JIT-Less Mode"‚Äîif it says "Test Passed," you‚Äôre good to go.
6. **Install a second instance of LiveContainer** via the main LiveContainer app.
7. **In LiveContainer Settings: Set JIT Enabler to StikJIT (Another LiveContainer).**

## Installing MeloNX & Enable StikJIT & Increasing RAM Limits
Apple limits apps to using only half of the device‚Äôs RAM, but **GetMoreMemory** by HugeBlack bypasses this restriction.
1. **Download MeloNX & memory entitlement:** [MeloNX Repo](https://git.743378673.xyz/MeloNX/MeloNX#readme) and **StikKIT IPA** from [StikJIT GitHub](https://github.com/0-Blu/StikJIT).
2. Add all three apps to the Apps section in LiveContainer. For each app: long-press the icon ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Convert to Shared App.
4. **Enable file picker & local notifications in MeloNX settings.**
![](https://i.imgur.com/WZShBKo.png)

5. **Run memory entitlement and log into your account to enable the entitlement for:**
    - LiveContainer
    - LiveContainer2
    - MeloNX
    - If errors occur, clean up Keychain and try again.
![](https://i.imgur.com/7cBMAJR.png)

1. **Reinstall LiveContainer & LiveContainer2** to apply the configuration.
2. **Reinstall SideStore from the app (do not just refresh it).**
3. **Upload the pairing file in StikJIT on LiveContainer2 and enable "Auto Quit After Enabling JIT."**

5. **Run MeloNX via LiveContainer1.**

## Adding keys, firmware, games on MeloNX
First-time setup:
1. Launch MeloNX via LiveContainer
2. Choose your `prod.keys` and `title.keys` files
3. Select your Switch firmware `.zip`
4. Go to settings and check to see if it has **JIT and extended RAM enabled**
![](https://i.imgur.com/1JVjXah.png)

You're done! Just tap MeloNX from LiveContainer whenever you want to play, even offline. Add games (.NSP or .XCI) by tapping the ‚ûï button.

I won‚Äôt go into detail on how to acquired keys, firmware, and games since this involves piracy. 
As far as I know, aside from downloading illegally, you can extract your own keys and firmware from your own Switch. 
For, uh, testing purposes, here‚Äôs a little base64: 

```

```

Some useful tips I‚Äôve come across:
- Always download both the **game** and its **update file** for the best performance.
- Large files may get stuck during transfers due to MeloNX‚Äôs lack of a proper file transfer UI.
## MeloNX Settings for best performance or least ram usage
### Use the following settings to get the best possible performance
```
Shader Cache: On (may causes games to use much more ram which can cause crashes on devices with not enough ram tho)
Disable VSync: Off (Enable if you want more than 30/60fps if your device can handle it)
Texture Recompression: On
MacroHLE: On
Docked Mode: Off
Resolution Scale: Use the lowest resolution you still find good where it doesn‚Äôt crash
Memory Manager: Sometimes "Host Unchecked (fast, unstable / unsafe" or "Host (fast)" has better performance
Ignore Missing Services: On
Debug Logs: Off
Trace Logs: Off
MVK: Pre-fill Metal Command Buffers: Off
```
### Use the following settings to get the least amount of ram usage in a game
```
Shader Cache: Off
Texture Recompression: On
MacroHLE: On
Docked Mode: Off
Resolution Scale: The lower, the better
Expand Guest Ram: Off
Ignore Missing Services: On
Debug Logs: Off
Trace Logs: Off
Memory Manager Mode: Host (fast)
Disable PTC: On
```

## Final Thoughts
Running _Tears of the Kingdom_ on an iPhone sounds like science fiction‚Äîbut it‚Äôs real. Once it‚Äôs all set up, you‚Äôll be gaming at full speed, offline, on hardware that was *should* be meant for this.
Even crazier? This lays the groundwork for full-blown VM emulation. Some users are already running macOS Sonoma on iPad using UTM.
