## How I got here
Hey! I'm **Hoang Xuan Phuc**, but everyone just calls me **Felix**.

I'm a CompSci student at the University of South Florida (USF), hailing from Vietnam. Growing up, my life was basically a script: Wake up at 6 a.m., school at 7, extra school at 5, eat, sleep, repeat. That was my loop until 5th grade, when my mom gifted me an old laptop.

My first thought? Games. But that dream died _fast_. I quickly realized I owned a "potato laptop" after trying to run some random FPS (you know, back when they still used `Adobe Flash Player`). Sure, it was _playable_, but the lag was so bad I'd have to be a psychic to get a shot in before getting blasted.

Being a problem-solving nerd, I got hooked on a new question: **How do I make this thing _not_ suck?**

So, thanks to `Google` and `QuanTriMang.com`, I went down the rabbit hole of 20-step optimization guides. I was editing startup programs in `msconfig.exe`, killing services in `services.msc`, and even foolishly trying to "download more RAM" by messing with `pagefile.sys` (protip: don't do this). Honestly, every megabyte of RAM I freed up was a bigger rush than actually playing the game.

This tinkering addiction escalated. Before I knew it, I'd installed Linux, ditching games entirely just for the _theory_ of more speed. And man, the learning curve wasn't a curve, it was a cliff. I spent more time fixing the OS than using it.

- Touch-pad scrolls too fast? Have fun digging in random config files.
- Can't type? Oh, right, I'm in `vim`. Press `i` for `Insert Mode`.
- Okay, typed my line... now **how the hell do I save and quit???**

Yeah, it was annoying. But it was also _so much fun_. I realized I love this stuff—digging into the guts of a computer and making it my own.

The only problem? My brain isn't big enough to remember all the commands and weird tricks. Every time I'd reinstall or get a new PC, I'd waste hours hunting down the same guides and my own notes.

**So, this blog is my solution.** It's basically my public brain-dump. A place to store my "hidden recipes" and all the cool (or weird) stuff I find. It's my personal notebook, my journey, and maybe—just maybe—it'll inspire you to break... er, I mean, _tinker_ with your own stuff, too.

## My "On-Paper" Stats
