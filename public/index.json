I am¬†Hoang Xuan Phuc, but you can simply address me as¬†Felix. Since you‚Äôve taken the time to explore my corner of the internet, I suppose it‚Äôs only fair to share a bit more about myself. You might notice that I don‚Äôt often open up like this in the offline world‚ÄîI tend to be somewhat of an introvert. That said, I genuinely enjoy meeting new people and engaging in meaningful conversations. It‚Äôs just that, for some reason, talking about myself can be a bit of a challenge. Perhaps it‚Äôs a matter of communication skills. I‚Äôve sometimes struggled to articulate my thoughts, especially when diving into complex ideas. But don‚Äôt get me wrong; I‚Äôm confident in my ability to strike up a conversation with just about anyone, even strangers. It‚Äôs as if my brain goes into overdrive, overthinking every word when I‚Äôm attempting to present information. But does an introduction really have to be so complex? I doubt it, right? Then there‚Äôs the notion that maybe there isn‚Äôt all that much to tell about me. When someone asks me to talk about myself, I sometimes feel like I should provide a comprehensive biography dating back to my birth. The truth is, even that wouldn‚Äôt take more than a minute to recount. What I‚Äôve come to realize, though, is that the subject I could talk about endlessly is the future and the plans I‚Äôve always envisioned. But that‚Äôs not entirely ideal, is it? I don‚Äôt want to be the kind of person who can only talk about their hypothetical future while neglecting their actual past. I‚Äôm well aware that our lives are shaped by our experiences and the lessons we‚Äôve learned from the challenges we‚Äôve faced. Yet, if you can‚Äôt recall those experiences or share them with others, it can feel like a missed opportunity. So, here‚Äôs the reason behind this website. It‚Äôs a place where I hope to bridge the gap between my past and my future, sharing my journey, experiences, and thoughts with you and anyone else who stumbles upon it. It‚Äôs a way for me to reflect, remember, and, hopefully, inspire others along the way.

Initially, I tried Docker but found it lacking: No file watching/auto-triggering Dependency management was clunky So, I switched to the Python local version, which integrated smoothly with Suwayomi. Now, I just needed a way to automate the process. (Interestingly, after several weeks, I switched back to using the Docker version, but this time with an added batch-script setup and my own configuration.) The first version of my script was simple: Scan the INPUT_FOLDER (.i.e. the downloads folder I set up above) for new chapters. Run the manga translator command. Save the output in a matching OUTPUT_FOLDER. (.i.e the translated folder) Example set up: sudo apt install cython3 conda create -n manga-trans python=3.12 pip python -m manga_translator local -v -i ../suwayomi/data/downloads/mangas/Rawkuma\\ \\(JA\\)/Grapara\\!\\ Raw/Chapter\\ 13/ --output ../suwayomi/data/translated/Grapara\\!\\ Raw\\ translated/Chapter\\ 13/ --use-gpu --config-file examples/config-example.json This worked, but there was one big problem: it wasn‚Äôt fully automated.

To achieve the setup I have today, I had to tear down and rebuild this workstation more than 10 times. Finally, I am truly satisfied with it. It not only satisfies me aesthetically but also makes me eager to work as soon as I step into this room (well, not quite true because nowadays most of the time I feel most productive when working from a coffee shop‚Ä¶).

It shows a Lenovo 14-inch Intel Celeron old school laptop that I inherited from my mom when I was just a 7th-grader. It‚Äôs a typical low-end Windows laptop from before 2015, and I couldn‚Äôt even take it anywhere because the connector between the monitor and the keyboard was broken. I remember trying to install some games on it, but the only one that ran smoothly was Halflife 2, which is from the 2000s. Despite its limitations, I feel positive towards this laptop because it served my educational needs and taught me how to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù things‚Ä¶ Over the years, although there were countless times when this low-end laptop frustrated me with its 2GB RAM and inability to open more than three Google Chrome tabs, it still fulfilled my educational requirements. Adding a second monitor that my mom had left over from her office was a game changer for me, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when I had to attend Zoom classes. This additional monitor played a crucial role in helping me get accepted into three top high schools in my country before I eventually got a new PC. This laptop also taught me the initial steps of exploring the Internet effectively and opened up a world of computer science knowledge. To this day, even though I couldn‚Äôt keep the laptop because I donated it to my cousin, I still use the second monitor as it has become an integral part of my workflow. Since having two screens, my work productivity has significantly increased as I can multitask and access information more easily. In fact, if given the choice between an extremely high-end laptop with only one screen or a mediocre one with an additional screen, I would not hesitate to choose the latter.

Boom, a big upgrade coming right there. Like, literally from a $50 budget laptop to a $700 high-end PC. Not to mention this is also the first time I have had the courage to ask my mom for a present, as I usually shy away from asking my parents to spend money on me. However, this time was different because for the first time in my life, my parents were ready to spend this much for my attendance at Amsterdam High School. However, as much of a tragedy it may seem, this is also the time when hardware components became so expensive due to the rise of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency mining. So if I had the opportunity to go back, I would probably wait until November 2021 to buy a new one because with the same specifications, I could have spent only around $400 on this one. Still, I am so grateful for this because it was a big transition from my last laptop and it serves my needs way better than its capabilities. Everything got replaced except for the DELL second monitor mentioned above. I also took the old hard disk from my laptop to serve as the second hard drive for my computer. Truth be told, initially, I was very excited to set up my workstation. I often visited Facebook groups and watched videos about workspaces, cable management, decorative accessories, and more from various individuals. After countless times hiding under the table trying to make the cables look organized, I finally got the final setup shown above. However, I was too focused on aesthetics without actually realizing what was most important: productivity. After about three months of attending online Zoom classes where my bed and chair were so close together, I started developing bad habits. Whenever I felt tired or sleepy during class, it was too easy for me to just fall back onto that bed and have a sleepy ‚Äúday‚Äù. It was good for my health but definitely not good for my studies, so I once again had to make a change.

As you can see, there is a table serving as a divider between the chair and the bed. This setup prevents me from ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù when I have to attend a Zoom class or pull an all-nighter. The table not only serves as a place to put additional things on but also separates my ‚Äúwork‚Äù mode from my ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù mode. Additionally, the second old monitor has now been turned into a vertical one since the space on the table has become narrower. However, the main reason for this change is because there is some content that I really love to view vertically, such as articles, coding documentation, or Phuong Ly‚Äôs videos -)).

I also switched my operating system from Windows to MacOS, but instead of buying a brand new Mac, I ‚ÄúHackintoshed‚Äù my computer. Additionally, I purchased a refurbished RX580 VGA from a Facebook marketplace because my old GT1030 had some compatibility issues with MacOS. And that‚Äôs the end of my workspace optimization journey. As you probably expected, having a more modern and optimized workspace can lead to increased productivity, right? Well, that‚Äôs not entirely true. I‚Äôve come to realize that true productivity comes from within and is not solely dependent on the hardware or number of monitors you have. The funny thing is that even though my laptop setup when I was in 9th grade had the lowest specifications, I felt second most productive compared to my different setups mentioned above. I guess it‚Äôs because there were fewer distractions with that setup; all I could do was study. On the other hand, with the high-end PC setup, it‚Äôs easy to get distracted and procrastinate with games and social media sites.

It offers two tracks, Hipster and Hacker, catering to UX/UI designers and developers respectively. Although I initially had confidence in joining the Hacker Track, I ultimately decided to participate in the Hipster Track. This choice was driven by my desire to have better overall project management skills and to further enhance my UX/UI abilities. However, it turned out that I still had to write code for the team despite being in the Hipster Track. (you would know the reason later on this article) The hackathon consists of three rounds. The first round (Breaker Challenge) is an individual challenge with separate tracks: Hipster and Hacker. Each track would receive support by various workshops, covering the knowledge required to participate to the competition. At the end of the first round, participants from each track are required to submit an assignment that showcases their newly acquired knowledge. For Hipsters, this involves designing an e-commerce landing page with a high-fidelity wireframe created on Figma, along with user personas and user journey details related to their product. Hackers must submit a functional website developed using Flask framework and incorporating some form of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù feature. 150 participants from both tracks are then chosen for Round 2: Innovation Spirit, where they form teams of 2 Hipsters and 2 Hackers and choose from four tracks: Sustainability, Education, Mental Health, or Community. Only 15 teams advance to the final round, The Hacking Day, with 7 team awards and 2 individual awards.

This drove me to participate in this competition, with a focus on creating another application to finish an overall optimized system for reducing e-waste. In the initial round, where I had to design a landing page for an e-commerce site, I immediately decided to develop a marketplace for trading refurbished devices. This solidified my determination to craft a comprehensive product idea for the subsequent rounds, even though I wasn‚Äôt certain of advancing beyond round 1. Recognizing the importance of further developing this idea, I dedicated significant time to meticulously designing wireframes for the project. However, due to personal circumstances, I found myself dangerously close to missing the round 1 deadline.

The only difference was that he had chosen to join the Hacker track. After a brief discussion, I decided to join him along with two others: his friend Huy, and a randomly recruited girl named Minh Chau. While the three of us were from Hanoi and Minh Chau hailed from Son La, it was her who took the initiative throughout our collaboration (and also contributed the most). That was also the reason why she became a leader for my team. Well, she is really good at project management and business analytics, but underperforming in software development. That also the time I became the Software Development Lead The initial meeting went smoothly as we all introduced ourselves and comfortably shared our ideas from the first round for brainstorming purposes. While I don‚Äôt want to come across as boastful, it became apparent to me that my assignment was the only one with the potential to win major awards. Huy and Linh from the Hacker Track supported my viewpoint. They agreed that my already beautiful interface and adherence to guidelines would significantly reduce the time spent on front-end development. However, Minh Chau had some reservations. She did like my idea, but she stated that it just so ‚Äúordinary‚Äù and ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù. After several more meetings filled with debates and discussions, we eventually reached a consensus on what we should create for rounds 2 and 3: a counterfeit product verification system. You might be wondering, is that all? Why were you so easily compromised? Well, I did attempt to negotiate with her. However, as mentioned earlier, choosing the idea of creating a marketplace for refurbished devices would result in my team being disqualified from the STEAM Hacks competition if they discovered any correlation or signs of idea copying from my Samsung product last year. On another note, my primary motivation for participating in this competition was not solely to complete my Samsung product but rather to acquire and expand my knowledge and skills.

I can‚Äôt even begin to describe how unproductive the environment was compared to our typically smooth and comfortable team discussions. I don‚Äôt want to point fingers or be too hard on myself, but it‚Äôs clear that none of the Hacker members on our team were pulling their weight. It‚Äôs not entirely their fault though; they excel in competitive coding, but they weren‚Äôt adequately prepared for web development or a hackathon like this. So, I found myself having to join them in tackling the code development. Furthermore, our team was currently facing a conflicting idea with our leader regarding the counterfeit product verification system. Unlike other student projects that typically involve education or mental health, this idea feels challenging for us to create something meaningful. Initially, our leader proposed using AI to detect fake patterns or incorrect labels, but our team lacks the competence in developing AI-related features. Additionally, implementing such a system seemed impossible and unproductive due to the vast variety of products and their unique fake versions. Moreover, there are also concerns about implementation costs and potential returns. Well, turns out, every cloud has a silver lining. Firstly, despite my limited technical knowledge, I embraced the opportunity to learn backend development on my own, driven by a strong determination and purpose. This made me feel alive and empowered. Specifically, I was fortunate to have access to the FlutterFlow Education program, which enabled me to quickly learn and utilize their user-friendly software for creating meaningful applications. This greatly reduced our front-end development time and expanded my knowledge of this powerful tool. Furthermore, I acquired proficiency in Flask to develop an API backend application that automatically serves ML models trained through the Teachable Machine platform. This saved me the tedious task of manually researching and collecting data for training models. In short, this challenging experience has taught me invaluable skills and knowledge. Coming back to the idea conflicting issue, because I initially had doubts about the leader‚Äôs counterfeit verification concept, I decided to develop the refurbished marketplace feature alongside it. However, I also noticed her dedication and effort towards this idea, despite its nearly impossible implementation. So I had to come all the way to redevelop the application. Finally, on the last day, things became even more intense than before as we submitted our application just five minutes before the deadline.

Our product was only halfway developed and didn‚Äôt efficiently solve our problems. When we received the results for the second round at midnight, we celebrated together briefly before diving into a meeting for planning and improvement. During this meeting, we had a tense debate as Chau and I wanted to continue finishing the project for the learning experience, while Linh and Huy would only participate if we had a chance of winning a major award. After much discussion, we agreed to aim for the Pitching Award. I was extremely busy during this time as I had to focus on my IELTS practice and essay writing. Additionally, I indulged in my habit of tinkering with tech devices and took the opportunity to develop my own server using an old case my mom had brought home. However, returning to the topic of STEAM Hacks, after resolving our conflicts, we came up with a new idea to improve the process of verifying counterfeit products. This involved implementing barcode scanning and utilizing NLP instructions. We discovered that solely using images to identify fake products was not as effective as incorporating physical interactions such as smell or embossed marks. This idea also stemmed from my recent knowledge about NLP and LangChain that I coincidentally learned about just a few weeks ago. And so, without further ado, our journey continues. Our journey began just three days before the Hacking Day, thanks to my procrastination. The day before the final, we had a meeting scheduled with our counselor and advisor. It was embarrassing because our team had barely finished the final version of our product. However, this gave us an opportunity to ask our advisor important questions regarding the challenges we were currently facing. As I delved deeper into NLP and specifically LangChain, I discovered that it was poorly developed and relied heavily on tokenization. After a lengthy discussion, we also learned some valuable techniques for optimizing it. And in the same day, we were able to complete our underperforming product, making it ready for the presentation scheduled for the following day. On the day of our presentation, nothing out of the ordinary occurred. However, one memorable moment stands out in my mind. Our team made the decision to demonstrate the live usage of our application. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt go as planned and resulted in uproarious laughter from the audience. Despite this setback, we were able to complete the presentation without further complications (although our question and answer session left much to be desired).

After brushing my teeth, I fumbled on my computer to download videos on photography tutorials from YouTube to watch and learn on the way (I was assigned to take photos even though I‚Äôve never held a camera before -))). I downloaded the videos and finished preparing my gear by 4:40 am, then called my dad to drive me.

It was quite fascinating, to be honest, because like everything else, it has its own rules and standards that we can learn in a simple and understandable way.

At Sapa Hope Center, the most surprising thing for me was the extremely warm welcome from the kids. Although many of them couldn‚Äôt speak Vietnamese (Sapa is a land of convergence for 5 different ethnic groups), they were enthusiastic and innocent. As soon as I arrived, the kids gave each of us a flower and a welcoming card, which they had drawn themselves. The drawings looked simple, but I believe they came from the sincere and innocent hearts of these little ones. During the self-introduction, I was quite surprised when the owner of the center turned out to be a young man (seemingly stepping out of ‚ÄúSilent Sapa‚Äù) who had studied abroad in Singapore. After visiting this place, he fell in love with it, despite numerous opportunities in the city. Even his relatives thought he was ‚Äúcharmed‚Äù (there is a local belief in enchantment being quite common here).

The reason for this was that our goal for the day was to teach the kids English through themed movies and songs, requiring a dark room to make it easier for the children to see. During the morning teaching session, we played songs and shared stories about the movie Frozen, then guided the children to fill in blanks or answer questions about the movie content. However, it seemed that some of the children had already seen the movie before, and for some, it was a challenging task. Despite our efforts to maintain their interest in the first 1-2 hours, we couldn‚Äôt make that teaching session as effective as we hoped. After lunch, Chau Anh (from our group) decided to show the kids a famous Disney movie about three squirrels to regain their interest. However, after 15 minutes of screening, the kids seemed bored with the movie and began to leave the room. Faced with this situation, our group decided to stop showing movies and return to the large activity hall, directly interacting and teaching the kids how to create and play games. Indeed, the children here were too accustomed to watching movies whenever there was a foreign charity group visiting, so they had become disinterested in watching another movie. Instead, they enjoyed running and playing with everyone ‚Äì something they rarely get to do when charity groups visit. Therefore, when given the opportunity to play freely that day, the adorable kids at Sapa Hope Center were very happy and cooperated completely with the older members, creating laughter for both sides. The older members playing games designed by the children After the play session, we presented books, notebooks, and clothes to the kids Upon returning to the hotel, we held a meeting with the staff to address the issue of the ‚Äúlesson plan burnout‚Äù that occurred that day. However, what I remember most from that evening was the conversation between me, Ms. Mai, and Ch·ªã Minh H√†‚Äôs mother. Ms. Mai shared a lot about the difficulties and experiences in understanding the psychology of teaching preschool and elementary school children. (There was one saying from her that I found very insightful: ‚ÄúIt takes losing nine toes to finally realize we need to protect the remaining one.‚Äù) Ch·ªã Minh H√†‚Äôs mother also shared a lot about life in Russia.

The goal for our group on this day was to educate the children about personal hygiene skills through lively videos and practical exercises. However, unlike the previous day, this time, we decided to use the large activity hall (rather than the dining area, which was too dark and dirty by evening) for the lecture and for the convenience of teaching in a more dynamic manner (as discussed and planned at the hotel after reflecting on the previous teaching session). Indeed, moving to a spacious and clean room, as shown in the picture, significantly improved the comfort for both the teachers and the children. Additionally, we must acknowledge the enthusiasm of the two ‚Äúteachers,‚Äù Nhi and Linh, who brought interesting lessons on personal hygiene to the children. The two of them, along with the entire group, collaborated to guide the children in dancing to songs, creating artwork, and participating in related games. Later, the children practiced by taking fun quizzes, such as coloring objects corresponding to their daily hygiene items. While I wasn‚Äôt the main photographer for the morning session, I felt delighted to participate in a different role as a support person, helping the children complete their tasks in a joyful and easy manner. After completing the teaching session at the center, in the afternoon, our group planned to visit each child‚Äôs home to better understand their family situations and daily lives. At each home, we spent some time listening to the children‚Äôs stories and the family‚Äôs struggles. It was an opportunity to gain insight into the hardships they face and learn about the various professions within each household.

There were many firsts for me on this journey: the first time participating in a charity trip without my parents, the first time having to plan and adapt to everything on my own, the first time being the one behind the camera capturing moments and actions throughout the trip, and more. In addition to the experiential lessons from these firsts, I also met and learned a lot from the children, older members, and staff. Everyone helped me engage and listen to many unique and diverse stories. It can be said that this trip will probably leave a deep memory during my high school years.
